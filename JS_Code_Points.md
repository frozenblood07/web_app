## JS Code Points

### Things I liked
- Used ES6.
- function displayTop - items: items.slice() passing items by value and not by reference.
- Use of meaningful variable names.
- use of document.getElement not not using jquery


### Things I dislike
- Use of var in for loop - should have used let instead
-  const a = this.items.splice() What is the point of assign value to variable and not using it. There is no point in assigning the value.
- Since the member functions are not being accessed from outside class they should have been private.
- Indentation was off.
- Comments could have been added to the class.Just 1 line description in general in fine.
